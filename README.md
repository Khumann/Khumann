### Hi there 👋

## I’m not  typical researcher, but my curiosity knows no bounds. Armed with determination, I dive into the world of Data Science. 
### Uncover hidden patterns! Imagine data as a treasure map—each point, each line, a clue waiting to be deciphered. Algorithms waltz with me through dimensions, I draw those patterns out, making data useful. It’s like turning chaos into constellations.
